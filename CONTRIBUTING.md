## How to enable cloud features when building from source?

For development purposes, you may need to enable the phospho cloud features. If so, you'll need some secret token values that you need a member of the phospho team to share with you. Then, here is how to input them:

1. Create the file `dashboard/.env` with these variables:

```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL="..."
VITE_SUPABASE_KEY="..."
```

Make sure to rebuild the frontend (Vite bakes these variables in compiled code).

2. Create the file `phosphobot/resources/tokens.toml`

```
ENV = "dev"
SENTRY_DSN = "..."
POSTHOG_API_KEY = "..."
POSTHOG_HOST = "..."
SUPABASE_URL = "..."
SUPABASE_KEY = "..."
MODAL_API_URL = "..."
```
