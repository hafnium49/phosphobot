# Dual SO-101 Pose Control

This example demonstrates how to control a pair of SO-101 robotic arms using direct pose commands (position + orientation) instead of AI control.

## Prerequisites

- Two SO-101 robotic arms connected to your computer
- Phosphobot server running (`phosphobot run`)
- Python 3.10+

## What this example does

1. **Direct Pose Control**: Move arms to specific 3D positions and orientations
2. **Dual Arm Coordination**: Synchronize movements between two arms
3. **Gripper Control**: Open and close grippers independently
4. **Relative Movements**: Make incremental adjustments to current poses

## Hardware Setup

1. Connect both SO-101 arms to your computer via USB
2. Make sure both arms are detected by the phosphobot server
3. Arms will be assigned robot IDs: 0 (first) and 1 (second)

## Installation

```bash
# Install required dependencies
pip install httpx numpy

# Or if using the script requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Basic Example
```bash
python dual_arm_basic.py
```

### Advanced Coordination
```bash
python dual_arm_coordination.py
```

### Interactive Control
```bash
python interactive_control.py
```

## Key Concepts

### Coordinate System
- **X-axis**: Forward/backward (positive = forward)
- **Y-axis**: Left/right (positive = left)  
- **Z-axis**: Up/down (positive = up)
- **Orientations**: Euler angles in degrees (rx, ry, rz)

### Units
- **Absolute positions**: Meters
- **Relative positions**: Centimeters
- **Orientations**: Degrees
- **Gripper**: 0.0 = closed, 1.0 = open


## Advanced Features

This package includes additional examples with advanced features:

### üîç Workspace Analysis
For detailed workspace validation and safety checking:
```bash
cd ../09-workspace-analysis
python workspace_demo.py
```
- Pose reachability checking
- Workspace boundary visualization
- Forbidden pose detection
- Safe pose suggestions

### üîß Inverse Kinematics
For advanced inverse kinematics demonstrations:
```bash
cd ../10-inverse-kinematics-demo
python inverse_kinematics_demo.py
```
- Manual joint angle control
- Forward/inverse kinematics testing
- Trajectory planning examples

### Safety Notes
- Start with small movements to test your setup
- Keep emergency stop accessible
- Ensure adequate workspace for both arms
- Test single arm movements before dual arm coordination
- **Always validate poses** using the workspace analysis tools

## Troubleshooting

### Arms not detected
1. Check USB connections
2. Restart phosphobot server: `phosphobot run`
3. Verify robot IDs in the web dashboard at `localhost:80`

### Movement errors
1. Check if arms are in a safe starting position
2. Reduce movement distances
3. Ensure target positions are within arm reach

### Connection issues
1. Verify phosphobot server is running on `localhost:80`
2. Check firewall settings
3. Try restarting the server
