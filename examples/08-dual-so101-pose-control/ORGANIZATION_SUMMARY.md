## SO-101 Dual Arm Example Organization Summary

The SO-101 dual arm examples have been successfully organized into three focused directories:

### üìÅ `/examples/08-dual-so101-pose-control/` (Main Scripts)
**Core dual arm control examples with basic functionality:**
- `dual_arm_basic.py` - Basic dual-arm control demonstrations
- `dual_arm_coordination.py` - Synchronized dual-arm movements  
- `interactive_control.py` - Real-time interactive control interface
- `dual_so101_controller.py` - Core controller library (self-contained)
- `requirements.txt` - Dependencies
- `README.md` - Main documentation with links to advanced features

### üìÅ `/examples/09-workspace-analysis/` (Advanced Analysis)
**Dedicated workspace validation and safety tools:**
- `workspace_check.py` - Fast pose validation utilities
- `workspace_validator.py` - Comprehensive workspace analysis tool
- `workspace_demo.py` - Interactive workspace validation demo
- `dual_so101_controller.py` - Controller with full workspace validation
- `requirements.txt` - Dependencies
- `README.md` - Comprehensive workspace analysis documentation (merged quick reference + forbidden pose detection)

### üìÅ `/examples/10-inverse-kinematics-demo/` (IK Learning)
**Focused inverse kinematics education and testing:**
- `inverse_kinematics_demo.py` - Interactive IK demonstration  
- `dual_so101_controller.py` - Controller with IK focus
- `requirements.txt` - Dependencies
- `README.md` - IK-focused documentation and learning guide

### ‚úÖ Completed Tasks
- [x] Moved workspace analysis materials to dedicated directory
- [x] Moved inverse kinematics materials to dedicated directory  
- [x] Merged quick reference/forbidden pose detection into workspace analysis README
- [x] Updated all script references to point to new locations
- [x] Ensured all scripts are self-contained with proper imports
- [x] Fixed corrupted controller files across all directories
- [x] Verified all scripts import and run correctly
- [x] Updated main README to reference advanced feature directories
- [x] Cleaned up old/redundant files from main directory

### üéØ Result
- **Cleaner main directory** with focus on basic dual arm control
- **Modular organization** for advanced features
- **Self-contained examples** that work independently
- **Clear navigation** between related examples and documentation
- **Maintained backward compatibility** while improving organization

The dual SO-101 pose control example codebase is now well-organized, up-to-date, and easy to navigate!
