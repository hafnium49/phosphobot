# Example 5 Hand Tracking - Environment Setup Complete ‚úÖ

## Environment Status
- **Python Version**: 3.11 (conda environment: `mediapipe-env`)
- **MediaPipe Version**: 0.10.21 ‚úÖ WORKING
- **OpenCV Version**: 4.12.0.88 ‚úÖ WORKING  
- **NumPy Version**: 2.2.6 ‚úÖ WORKING
- **Requests Version**: 2.32.4 ‚úÖ WORKING

## Test Results

### ‚úÖ Successfully Tested
1. **MediaPipe Initialization**: Hand tracking models load correctly
2. **Hand Detection Pipeline**: Image processing functional
3. **Hand Calculations**: Open/close state calculation working
4. **Dependency Imports**: All core libraries import without errors

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Expected Limitations in Current Environment
1. **Camera Access**: No webcam available (`/dev/video0` not found)
2. **Graphics Warnings**: EGL/Mesa warnings (non-critical, don't affect functionality)

### üéâ BONUS: Robot Server Available!
- **Robot Control Server**: ‚úÖ RUNNING on `localhost:80`
- **Movement Commands**: ‚úÖ WORKING (tested with sample coordinates)
- **Server Initialization**: ‚úÖ SUCCESSFUL

## How to Use

### In Development Environment (Current)
```bash
# Activate the environment
conda activate mediapipe-env

# Test MediaPipe functionality
python test_mediapipe.py

# Try hand tracking (will show connection errors but MediaPipe works)
python hand_tracking.py
```

### In Production Environment (With Hardware)
```bash
# 1. Connect webcam (server already running!)
# 2. Run hand tracking
conda activate mediapipe-env
python hand_tracking.py
```

## Script Functionality

The `hand_tracking.py` script:
- Captures video from webcam
- Detects up to 2 hands using MediaPipe
- Calculates hand position (wrist coordinates)
- Determines hand open/closed state (thumb-to-index distance)
- Sends control commands to robot server via HTTP POST
- Displays real-time overlay with hand tracking data

## Environment Setup Commands Used

```bash
# Created Python 3.11 environment for MediaPipe compatibility
conda create -n mediapipe-env python=3.11 -y
conda activate mediapipe-env

# Installed core dependencies
pip install --upgrade mediapipe opencv-python requests numpy matplotlib

# Verified installation
python -c "import mediapipe as mp; print(f'MediaPipe {mp.__version__} ready!')"
```

## Status: ALMOST READY FOR HARDWARE TESTING üöÄ

The MediaPipe hand tracking environment is fully set up and functional. The robot control server is already running! When connected to:
1. A webcam (for hand detection) - **ONLY MISSING COMPONENT**

The hand tracking will provide real-time robot control based on hand gestures and positions.
